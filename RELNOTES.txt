---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.1

  * Added -D for BSAFE String Functions within Makefile
  * Initial work on port of ospopenssl.c includes SSLeay
  * New version of license agreement for LICENSE.txt
  * Added critical = False for TN extensions for OSP messages
  * Added T_strcpy, T_strcmp, T_strlen callbacks for BSAFE
  * Changed the way headers were identified within HTTP messages
  * Fixed a couple of bad references in the client auth code.
  * Changed formatting, and added osp macros for client auth code.
  * Changes in detecting header types within ospsocket.c
  * Added OSP macros in ospxml.c
  * Created separate OSPM_GETSOCKERR macro for Unix and Windows

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.5.2

  * Added code to improve message queuing.
  * Added code to eliminate memory leaks.
  * Made the HTTP reader case-insensitive.
  * Several functions were changed to their macro equivalents.
  * Changed case on content-types within HTTP messages.
  * Eliminated some compiler warnings.
  * Implemented "subscriber" type in SourceAlternate messages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.5.4

  * Added parenthesis to variables contained in macros.
  * Eliminated unnecessary macros.
  * Corrected macro OSPM_GETHOSTBYNAME to accept empty values.
  * Eliminated a potential memory leak in OSPPTransactionDelete.
  * Corrected a conditional statement in OSPPTransIdRemove.
  * Added code for ASN.1 parser to recognize boolean tags.
  * Changes were made in order to eliminate the fixed size of altinfo,
    token, and callid structures.
  * Corrected a TransNexus Extension attribute (critical should equal
    "false")
  * Corrected a buffer overflow error when constructing an enrollment
    request.
  * Added the "-function" command to the enroll's help screen.
  * Added option to compile the Toolkit with POSIX threads on Win32
    platforms.
  * Added a new module to the test_app that implements non-blocking API for
    the Toolkit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.5.5

  * Changed the Toolkit to use the cryptographic algorithms
    within OpenSSL rather than BSAFE.
  * Updated Project and Make files.
  * Added "How to build the Toolkit" document.
  * New version of license agreement for LICENSE.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.5.6

  * Changed OSPPProviderNew to validate service points for correctness 
    before proceeding with creating a new provider instance.
  * Fixed handling of HTTP request to close connection - "Connection: close".
  * Fixed logic for searching available connection when HTTPMaxConnections
    has been reached.
  * Fixed a race condition in OSPPCommSignalAllConnections which could
    potentially cause a call to OSPPProviderDelete to deadlock.
  * Added initialization of random number generator engine using contents 
    of ".rnd" file expected to be found in the current directory.
  * Added Cryptogaphic Hardware Support, requires OpenSSL Engine library.
  * Replaced failure reasons with TCCodes defined in V.2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.6.0

  * Improved handling of HTTP and OSP codes.
  * MsgQueueDelete function now deletes mutex and cond var used by the Queue.
  * Added call start time to UsageIndication messages.
  * Added OpenSSL crypto lib support as an alternative to using existing crypto functionality.
  * Removed documentation from the build.
  * API CHANGES:
    * New type OSPTCERT defined in "include/ospdatatypes.h"
    * OSPPTransactionReportUsage function:
      * Added StartTime of type OSPTTIME
    * OSPPProviderNew function:
      * Changed the type of ospvLocalCertificate from (const void *) to (const OSPTCERT *)
      * Changed the type of ospvAuthorityCertificates from (const void *[]) to (const OSPTCERT *[])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.6.1

  * Upgraded TEP enrollment to use the API changes introduced in 2.6.0
  * Fixed memory leaks in the ospopenssl module.
  * Reduced compile time warnings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.6.2

  * Updated the Windows project files to Compile with MultiThreaded DLL libraries, Use standard libraries and to have the ..\crypto path in the Include directives.
  * Did changes to improve the log messages.
  * Modified the Makefile and the shell script to include changes for Linux compilation.
  * Ported the GETHOSTBYNAME function for Linux.
  * This Release has been tested with MS .NET.
  * This release requires no special instructions for compiling Openssl on Windows.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.7

  * Support for reporting the network identifier incorporated
  * Memory leaks and bug fixes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.8

  * Modified the enrollment procedure to read PEM format files instead of dat. The enrollment prodedure has now been much simplified by removing the cumbersome tasks of copying the keys and editing files. It is a 3 step procedure with no practical differences for the different platforms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.8.1

 * Updated test app to use PEM encoded crypto files for the following test_app.c functions - SetAuthorityCertificates, SetLocalKeys.
 * Makefile changes in the enroll and test Makefiles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.8.2
