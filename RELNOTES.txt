  * Eliminated a potential memory leak in OSPPTransactionDelete.
  * Corrected a conditional statement in OSPPTransIdRemove.
  * Added code for ASN.1 parser to recognize boolean tags.

    token, and callid structures.
  * Corrected a TransNexus Extension attribute (critical should equal
    "false")
  * Corrected a buffer overflow error when constructing an enrollment
    request.
  * Added the "-function" command to the enroll's help screen.
  * Added option to compile the Toolkit with POSIX threads on Win32
    platforms.
  * Added a new module to the test_app that implements non-blocking API for
    the Toolkit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.5.5

  * Changed the Toolkit to use the cryptographic algorithms
    within OpenSSL rather than BSAFE.
  * Updated Project and Make files.
  * Added "How to build the Toolkit" document.
  * New version of license agreement for LICENSE.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.5.6

  * Changed OSPPProviderNew to validate service points for correctness 
    before proceeding with creating a new provider instance.
  * Fixed handling of HTTP request to close connection - "Connection: close".
  * Fixed logic for searching available connection when HTTPMaxConnections
    has been reached.
  * Fixed a race condition in OSPPCommSignalAllConnections which could
    potentially cause a call to OSPPProviderDelete to deadlock.
  * Added initialization of random number generator engine using contents 
    of ".rnd" file expected to be found in the current directory.
  * Added Cryptogaphic Hardware Support, requires OpenSSL Engine library.
  * Replaced failure reasons with TCCodes defined in V.2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.6.0

  * Improved handling of HTTP and OSP codes.
  * MsgQueueDelete function now deletes mutex and cond var used by the Queue.
  * Added call start time to UsageIndication messages.
  * Added OpenSSL crypto lib support as an alternative to using existing crypto functionality.
  * Removed documentation from the build.
  * API CHANGES:
    * New type OSPTCERT defined in "include/ospdatatypes.h"
    * OSPPTransactionReportUsage function:
      * Added StartTime of type OSPTTIME
    * OSPPProviderNew function:
      * Changed the type of ospvLocalCertificate from (const void *) to (const OSPTCERT *)
      * Changed the type of ospvAuthorityCertificates from (const void *[]) to (const OSPTCERT *[])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.6.1

  * Upgraded TEP enrollment to use the API changes introduced in 2.6.0
  * Fixed memory leaks in the ospopenssl module.
  * Reduced compile time warnings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.6.2

  * Updated the Windows project files to Compile with MultiThreaded DLL libraries, Use standard libraries and to have the ..\crypto path in the Include directives.
  * Did changes to improve the log messages.
  * Modified the Makefile and the shell script to include changes for Linux compilation.
  * Ported the GETHOSTBYNAME function for Linux.
  * This Release has been tested with MS .NET.
  * This release requires no special instructions for compiling Openssl on Windows.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.7

  * Support for reporting the network identifier incorporated
  * Memory leaks and bug fixes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.8

  * Modified the enrollment procedure to read PEM format files instead of dat. The enrollment prodedure has now been much simplified by removing the cumbersome tasks of copying the keys and editing files. It is a 3 step procedure with no practical differences for the different platforms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.8.1

 * Updated test app to use PEM encoded crypto files for the following test_app.c functions - SetAuthorityCertificates, SetLocalKeys.
 * Makefile changes in the enroll and test Makefiles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.8.2

 * Bug fix for Linux. Problem because of trying to delete the mutex when it was locked
 * Implemeted support of SetServicePoints API in test_app, fixed a bug for this support in the Toolkit.
 * Log message changes for Linux and windows
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.8.3

 * Removed a Mutex Lock trace for Windows.
 * Modified a log message
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.9.0

 * Implemented 2 New API's :-
 * 1. OSPPTransactionGetDestProtocol - Reports the Protocol Information at the Current destination.
 *                                     Return Values are: SIP, H323_LRQ, H323_Setup, Undefined and Unknown.
 * 2. OSPPTransactionIsDestOSPEnabled - Reports whether the destination is OSP Enabled or Not.
 *                                      Return Values are: True, False, Undefined and Unknown.
 * Implemented a compile time flag - OSP_ALLOW_DUP_TXN, to enable reuse of transactions during token validation. This is to overcome the limitation we previously had where a token with the same transaction id could not be validated twice. This compile time flag either enables or disables repeat validations. This is particularly helpful in the fail over cases when we can get a Second Call Setup message for the same call.
 * Renamed a macro - 'min', to tr_min.
 * Modified the String comparison macro - OSPM_STRCMP, to ignore the case of the strings being compared.
 * Modified the token Validation procedure to check for an exact match between the Calling number passed in the API and the calling number in the token.Until now an empty calling number in the API and non empty calling number in the token ( or vice versa) did not generate a Validation Failure. However now, there has to be an exact match between the 2 numbers for the Validation process to pass. 
 * Added 4 new functions to the test app - GetCallingNumber, GetCalledNumber, SetCallingNumber, SetCalledNumber. The Set functions allow the user to change the calling and called numbers on the fly. The Test App starts with the configuration in the test.cfg file as default. However, there is now an option of changing these values at run time. The Get functions display the currently configured value.
